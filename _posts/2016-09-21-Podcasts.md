I love podcasts. Podcasts are a great medium that I use for entertainment and learning. I have had many people interested in the podcasts I listen to so I figured I'd put a list of them in one place.

I tried to order the podcasts from most liked to least liked. They are all podcasts I listen to so obviously I like them all.

These are the podcasts that I never miss an episode of:

For listening to podcasts, I use the app [Overcast](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8). It is a great podcast player. It is free so I recommend you try it.
